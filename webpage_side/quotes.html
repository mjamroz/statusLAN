<div class="quote_text"><span class="long">Since the Renaissance <b>mathematicians</b> have been concerned with the laws of cause and effect. That is, they have sought to employ the mathematical expression of these laws so that for any particular phenomenon there exists a one-to-one relationship between each cause and each effect. Their goal has been to solve the following simple-sounding problem: Given a unique cause, predict the unique effect. Many phenomena are well suited to this type of mathematical analysis, but there are also situations in which this approach fails. When this happens scientists have learned to rephrase the problem in the language of probability. One modern version of this idea can be described as follows: Given a unique cause, predict the most probable effect. A more general version of the problem is: Given the most probable cause, predict the most probable effect. These types of probabilistic problems are now a fundamental part of science, but this is a fairly recent development.</span></div> <small> <div class="source">&mdash; John Tabak, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Laws-Nature-Developing-Language/dp/0816049572" target="_blank">Mathematics and the Laws of Nature.

There was one particular tree of which we were not to partake, a tree of knowledge. Knowledge and understanding and wisdom were forbidden to us in this story. We were to be kept ignorant. But we couldn’t help ourselves. We were starving for knowledge - created hungry, you might say. This was the origin of all our troubles. In particular, it is why we no longer live in a garden: We found out too much.

With the forest one sees to the right when riding in a cart to Jaszuny. With a poem by a little-known poet. With human beings whose names still move me. And always the object of love was enveloped in erotic fantasy or was submitted, as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stendhal" target="_blank">Stendhal</a> to a “crystallization,” so it is frightful to think of that object as it was, naked among the naked things, and of the fairy tales about it one invents.

<div class="quote_text"><span class="long">Well, <b>the human impulse to remember is the fact that biologically we forget</b>. Because we biologically forget most of what we experience, we try to hold on to, cling on to the experiences, the memories, the opinions, the values, the facts that we treasure and therefore want to remember. But the important element of that is that for all of human history, remembering has been hard and costly, and thus required active work and energy to be put into it, while forgetting was easy. Today with the digital tools, it’s the other way around. Digital remembering is the default these days, and forgetting has become much, much harder.</span></div> <small> <div class="source">&mdash; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=174">Victor Mayer-Schönberger</a>,  professor of internet governance and regulation at the University of Oxford&#8217;s Internet Institute, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Delete-Virtue-Forgetting-Digital-Age/dp/0691138613">Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age</a></em>, Princeton University Press, 2009</div> </small>
<div class="quote_text"><span class="long">That we cannot comprehend the world on the direct path, in other words, through the uncritical, direct application of the intellect and its data, but are ever more deeply involved in absolute riddles when we reflect on it, points to the fact that the intellect, and so knowledge itself, is already something secondary, a mere product. It is brought about by the development of the inner being of the world, which consequently till then preceded it; and it finally appeared as a breaking through into the light from the obscure depths of the striving without knowledge, and the true nature of such striving exhibits itself as will in the self-consciousness that simultaneously arises in this way.

In our endeavor to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way to open the case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all of the things he observes, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison. But he certainly believes that, as his knowledge increases, his picture of reality will become simpler and simpler and will explain a wider and wider range of his sensuous impressions. He may also believe in the existence of the ideal limit of knowledge and that it is approached by the human mind. He may call this ideal limit the objective truth.</span></div> <small> <div class="source">&mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Infeld" target="_blank">Leopold Infeld</a> in <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/evolution-of-physics-from-early-concepts-to-relativity-and-quanta/oclc/16692544" target="_blank">The Evolution of Physics: From Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta</a></em>, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1966, p. 31.

It embodies, indeed, something better than the metaphysics of the Stone Age, namely, as was said, the inherited experience and acumen of many generations of men. But then, that acumen has been concentrated primarily upon the practical business of life. If a distinction works well for practical purposes in ordinary life (no mean feat, for even ordinary life is full of hard cases), then there is sure to be something in it, it will not mark nothing: yet this is likely enough to be not the best way of arranging things if our interests are more extensive or intellectual than ordinary. And again, that experience has been derived only from the sources available to ordinary men throughout civilized history: it has not been fed from the resources of the microscope and error and fantasy of all kinds do become incorporated in ordinary language and even sometimes stand up to the survival test (only, when they do, why should we not detect it?)
